# Help Momentum reform the Labour Party and elect Jeremy Corbyn as our next Prime Minister
Welcome to Momentum Tech Projects! This repository is where we post projects Momentum needs help with.

# Mission
Our objective is to build tools and technology to:
- Support organising and enable grassroots groups to self-organise
- Improve member experience, engagement and empowerment 
- Engage new members and expand our people-powered network
- Help achieve other Momentum objectives:
  - Prepare and organise for Labour Conference in September
  - Next general election preparation (voter registration, effective doorstep conversations, and training for both)
  
We believe as builders we have a responsibility to the world we all live in. Our job is to solve problems and the world is blessedly full of them. We join this community because we believe in making the world a better place through Momentum's grassroots organising and the greater network of the people-powered movement.

While our main activitiy is to build we ask everyone joining the community to **destroy** the following:
- **Your ego** - you are not bigger than the problems you are solving. Stand up for yourself walk proud, and carry yourself with self respect but never ever put yourself above the work you are doing. Real self-respect is tempered with humility, to understand when you are wrong and the confidence to know you can learn from it. Your ego is nothing but fear getting in the way of solutions.
- **Your fear** - you will be wrong, there will be someone better than you, you will fuck up some of the jobs, you will make mistakes and you will fully recover from them. We are here to learn from each other. 
- **Your apathy** - everyday thousands of builders go to work not caring what they're working on, just doing the next thing on their list, be intentional in your actions.
