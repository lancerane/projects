# projects
Welcome to Momentum Tech Projects! This repository is where we post projects Momentum needs help with.

# Mission
Our objective is to build tools to:
- Support organising

- Help achieve other Momentum objectives:
  - Prepare and organise for Labour Conference in September
  - Member and volunteer management
  - Next general election preparation (voter registration and building grassroots teams and capacity)
  - Enable grassroots groups to self-organise
  
# Next steps for getting involved
