# Help Momentum reform the Labour Party and elect Jeremy Corbyn as our next Prime Minister
Welcome to Momentum Tech Projects! This repository is where we post projects Momentum needs help with.

# Mission
Our objective is to build tools to:
- Support organising
- Improve member experience and empowerment 
- Help achieve other Momentum objectives:
  - Prepare and organise for Labour Conference in September
  - Member and volunteer management
  - Next general election preparation (voter registration and building grassroots teams and capacity)
  - Enable grassroots groups to self-organise
  
# Getting involved
1. [Join our slack](https://join.slack.com/mom-digihub-event/shared_invite/MjA5NDg2MTEzMjA1LTE0OTk0MzE0MTEtMDU3ZmQ3ZjkwYg), reach out to key contacts (found on every issue) on projects you’re interested in. 
2. [Check out the projects](#overview-of-projects)
- Anyone in the slack with "facilitator" after their name is here to help, flag them if you need anything
3. Check out `ActionKit` and its [documentation](https://roboticdogs.actionkit.com/docs/manual/guide/index.html) and [Github repositories](https://github.com/search?p=2&q=actionkit&type=Repositories) for other orgs that use `ActionKit`. `ActionKit` is the platform for many of our projects, it's where much of our website lives, how emails are targetted, and how we run A/B testing on our pages and emails. 
4. Request contributor access to the Momentum github by contact @euyterho or @erika-facilitator on Slack.
